you need to base64 encode this and also if you only put your urls it will not work. it's a back process inside the cloudflare worker.

So if you want multi URL :

- you take my URL (https://templates-portainer.ibaraki.app)

- you take your domains (["https://something.url.tld", "https://something.else.tld"])

- you encode them in base64 (https://www.base64encode.org/)

- you take the result and put it after my url (https://templates-portainer.ibaraki.app/?templates=<base64>)

Portainer does not support multi URL by default. That's why i did this.

If you want only your templates i can create another cloudflare worker without the default urls and services i put.
